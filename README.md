### 💡 About Me
I’m an IT Support & Junior System Administrator with 2+ years of experience supporting enterprise environments, currently working on large-scale infrastructure operations at Kuwait Oil Company (30,000+ users).

My background spans networking, Linux systems, security fundamentals, and automation. I’m actively building hands-on projects in Linux, DevOps, and cloud security with the goal of moving into a System / Security / DevOps Engineer role. 

### 🔭 Current Focus
- Linux fundamentals (processes, networking, permissions, services)
- Bash & Python for automation
- Docker & containerized deployments
- CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions
- Cloud fundamentals (AWS/Azure)

### 🛠️ Projects
- Linux administration labs (users, services, logs, networking)
- Automated system tasks using Bash & Python
- Dockerized applications with CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure-as-Code experiments using Terraform

### 🧰 Tech Stack
**Systems & OS:** Linux, Windows Server, Active Directory

**Security:** Security+, firewalls, access control, monitoring  
**DevOps:** Git, GitHub Actions, Docker, basic Kubernetes  
**Scripting:** Bash, Python, SQL  


### 📈 Learning Approach
I focus on building small, practical systems and understanding how things break, not just how they work. Documentation and repeatability matter to me.
